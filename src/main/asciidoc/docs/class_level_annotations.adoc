=== Class level annotations

The `@Test` annotation can be put on a class instead of a test method:

[source, java]

----
@Test
public class Test1 {
  public void test1() {
  }

  public void test2() {
  }
}
----

The effect of a class level @Test annotation is to make all the public methods of this class to become test methods even if they are not annotated. You can still repeat the `@Test` annotation on a method if you want to add certain attributes.

**For example:**

[source, java]

----
@Test
public class Test1 {
  public void test1() {
  }

  @Test(groups = "g1")
  public void test2() {
  }
}
----

will make both `test1()` and `test2()` test methods but on top of that, `test2()` now belongs to the group "g1".
