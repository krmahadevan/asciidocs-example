=== JUnit tests

TestNG can run JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 tests.  All you need to do is put the JUnit jar file on the classpath, specify your JUnit test classes in the `testng.classNames` property and set the `testng.junit` property to true:

[source, xml]

----
<test name="Test1" junit="true">
  <classes>
    <!-- ... -->
  </classes>
</test>
----

The behavior of TestNG in this case is similar to JUnit depending on the JUnit version found on the class path:

* JUnit 3:
** All methods starting with test* in your classes will be run
** If there is a method `setUp()` on your test class, it will be invoked before every test method
** If there is a method `tearDown()` on your test class, it will be invoked before after every test method
** If your test class contains a method `suite()`, all the tests returned by this method will be invoked
* JUnit 4:
** TestNG will use the `org.junit.runner.JUnitCore` runner to run your tests
