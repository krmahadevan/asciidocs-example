=== Overriding test methods

TestNG allows you to override and possibly skip the invocation of test methods. One example of where this is useful is if you need to your test methods with a specific security manager. You achieve this by providing a listener that implements {javadocs-base-url}/org/testng/IHookable.html[IHookable].

Here is an example with JAAS:

[source, java]

----
public class MyHook implements IHookable {
  public void run(final IHookCallBack icb, ITestResult testResult) {
    // Preferably initialized in a @Configuration method
    mySubject = authenticateWithJAAs();

    Subject.doAs(mySubject, new PrivilegedExceptionAction() {
      public Object run() {
        icb.callback(testResult);
      }
    };
  }
}
