== Kobalt A modern, versatile build system

Kobalt is a build system inspired by Gradle and Maven. It reuses the best concepts from these two successful and popular build systems while adding a few modern features of its own. Kobalt is written entirely in Kotlin and its build files are valid Kotlin files as well. Thanks to IDEA's top-notch support for Kotlin, writing Kobalt build files automatically benefits from auto-completion and all the other features that you are used to when writing code with your IDE of choice.
