=== Running TestNG

TestNG can be invoked in different ways:

* Command line
* xref:../ant.adoc[ant]
* xref:../eclipse.adoc[Eclipse]
* xref:../idea.adoc[IntelliJ's IDEA]

This section only explains how to invoke TestNG from the command line.
Please click on one of the links above if you are interested in one of the other ways.

Assuming that you have TestNG in your class path, the simplest way to invoke TestNG is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
java org.testng.TestNG testng1.xml [testng2.xml testng3.xml ...]
----

You need to specify at least one XML file describing the TestNG suite you are trying to run.
Additionally, the following command-line switches are available:

==== Command Line Parameters

|===
|Option |Argument |Documentation

|`-configfailurepolicy`
|`skip`|`continue`
|Whether TestNG should continue to execute the remaining tests in the suite or skip them if an @Before* method fails. Default behavior is `skip`.

|`-d`
|A directory
|The directory where the reports will be generated (defaults to `test-output`).

|`-dataproviderthreadcount`
|The default number of threads to use for data providers when running tests in parallel.
|This sets the default maximum number of threads to use for data providers when running tests in parallel. It will only take effect if the parallel mode has been selected (for example, with the `-parallel` option). This can be overridden in the suite definition.

|`-excludegroups`
|A comma-separated list of groups.
|The list of groups you want to be excluded from this run.

|`-groups`
|A comma-separated list of groups.
|The list of groups you want to run (e.g. "windows,linux,regression").

|`-listener`
|A comma-separated list of Java classes that can be found on your classpath.
|Lets you specify your own test listeners. The classes need to implement `org.testng.ITestListener`

|`-usedefaultlisteners`
|`true`|`false`
|Whether to use the default listeners

|`-methods`
|A comma separated list of fully qualified class name and method. For example `com.example.Foo.f1,com.example.Bar.f2`.
|Lets you specify individual methods to run.

|`-methodselectors`
|A comma-separated list of Java classes and method priorities that define method selectors.
|Lets you specify method selectors on the command line. For example: `com.example.Selector1:3,com.example.Selector2:2`

|`-parallel`
|`methods|tests|classes`
|If specified, sets the default mechanism used to determine how to use parallel threads when running tests. If not set, default mechanism is not to use parallel threads at all. This can be overridden in the suite definition.

|`-reporter`
|The extended configuration for a custom report listener.
|Similar to the `-listener` option, except that it allows the configuration of JavaBeans-style properties on the reporter instance.
Example: `-reporter com.test.MyReporter:methodFilter=*insert*,enableFiltering=true`
You can have as many occurrences of this option, one for each reporter that needs to be added.

|`-sourcedir`
|A semicolon separated list of directories.
|The directories where your javadoc annotated test sources are. This option is only necessary if you are using javadoc type annotations. (e.g. `src/test` or `src/test/org/testng/eclipse-plugin;src/test/org/testng/testng`).

|`-suitename`
|The default name to use for a test suite.
|This specifies the suite name for a test suite defined on the command line. This option is ignored if the `suite.xml` file or the source code specifies a different suite name. It is possible to create a suite name with spaces in it if you surround it with double-quotes `"like this"`.

|`-testclass`
|A comma-separated list of classes that can be found in your classpath.
|A list of class files separated by commas (e.g. `org.foo.Test1,org.foo.test2`).

|`-testjar`
|A jar file.
|Specifies a jar file that contains test classes. If a `testng.xml` file is found at the root of that jar file, it will be used, otherwise, all the test classes found in this jar file will be considered test classes.

|`-testname`
|The default name to use for a test.
|This specifies the name for a test defined on the command line. This option is ignored if the suite.xml file or the source code specifies a different test name. It is possible to create a test name with spaces in it if you surround it with double-quotes `"like this"`.

|`-testnames`
|A comma separated list of test names.
|Only tests defined in a <test> tag matching one of these names will be run.

|`-testrunfactory`
|A Java classes that can be found on your classpath.
|Lets you specify your own test runners. The class needs to implement `org.testng.ITestRunnerFactory`.

|`-threadcount`
|The default number of threads to use when running tests in parallel.
|This sets the default maximum number of threads to use for running tests in parallel. It will only take effect if the parallel mode has been selected (for example, with the -parallel option). This can be overridden in the suite definition.

|`-xmlpathinjar`
|The path of the XML file inside the jar file.
|This attribute should contain the path to a valid XML file inside the test jar (e.g. `resources/testng.xml`). The default is `testng.xml`, which means a file called `testng.xml` at the root of the jar file. This option will be ignored unless `-testjar` is specified.

|`-shareThreadPoolForDataProviders`
|`true`|`false`
|Indicates if TestNG should use a global shared thread-pool (at suite level) for running data driven tests. TestNG will consider the value set for the configuration parameter `-dataproviderthreadcount` as the size of the thread pool.

|`-useGlobalThreadPool`
|`true`|`false`
|Indicates if TestNG should use a global shared thread-pool (at suite level) for running regular and data driven tests. TestNG will consider the value set for the configuration parameter `-threadcount` as the size of the thread pool.

|`-log` (or) `-verbose`
|a valid log level
|Level of verbosity to be used when logging messages.

|`-junit`
|`true`|`false`
|Should TestNG run in JUnit mode.

|`-mixed`
|`true`|`false`
|Mixed mode - autodetect the type of current test and run it with appropriate runner.

|`-objectfactory`
|A string that represents a fully qualified class name.
|Fully qualified class name that implements `org.testng.ITestObjectFactory` which can be used to create test class and listener instances.

|`-ignoreMissedTestNames`
|`true`|`false`
|Ignore missed test names given by `-testnames` and continue to run existing tests, if any.

|`-skipfailedinvocationcounts`
|`true`|`false`
|Should TestNG skip failed invocation counts for data driven tests and tests driven by invocation counts.

|`-testRunFactory`
|A string that represents a fully qualified class name.
|Fully qualified class name that implements `org.testng.ITestRunnerFactory` which can be used to create custom test runners for running tests.

|`-suitethreadpoolsize`
|An integer value that represents the thread pool size. When not specified, defaults to `1`.
|Size of the thread pool to use to run suites.

|`-randomizesuites`
|`true`|`false`
|Whether to run suites in same order as specified in XML or not.

|`-alwaysrunlisteners`
|`true`|`false`
|Should method invocation listeners be run even for skipped methods.

|`-dependencyinjectorfactory`
|A string that represents a fully qualified class name.
|Fully qualified class name that implements org.testng.IInjectorFactory which can be used to handle with dependency injection.

|`-useGlobalThreadPool`
|`true`|`false`
|Should TestNG use a global Shared ThreadPool (At suite level) for running regular and data driven tests.

|===

This documentation can be obtained by invoking TestNG without any arguments.

You can also put the command line switches in a text file, say `c:\command.txt`, and tell TestNG to use that file to retrieve its parameters:

[source, shell]

----
C:> more c:\command.txt
-d test-output testng.xml
C:> java org.testng.TestNG @c:\command.txt
----

Additionally, TestNG can be passed properties on the command line of the Java Virtual Machine, for example

[source, shell]

----
java -Dtestng.test.classpath="c:/build;c:/java/classes;" org.testng.TestNG testng.xml
----

Here are the properties that TestNG understands:

==== System properties

|===
|Property |Type |Documentation

|`testng.test.classpath`
|A semicolon separated series of directories that contain your test classes.
|If this property is set, TestNG will use it to look for your test classes instead of the class path. This is convenient if you are using the package tag in your XML file and you have a lot of classes in your classpath, most of them not being test classes.

|===

*Example:*

[source, shell]

----
java org.testng.TestNG -groups windows,linux -testclass org.test.MyTest
----

The ant task and `testng.xml` allow you to launch TestNG with more parameters (methods to include, specifying parameters, etc...), so you should consider using the command line only when you are trying to learn about TestNG and you want to get up and running quickly.

TIP: The command line flags that specify what tests should be run will be ignored if you also specify a testng.xml file, with the exception of `-includedgroups` and `-excludedgroups`, which will override all the group inclusions/exclusions found in `testng.xml`.
